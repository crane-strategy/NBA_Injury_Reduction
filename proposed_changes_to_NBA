Objective: 
1. Reduce injuries in the NBA.

Problem:
  1. Injuries harm the longetivity of careers.
  2. Intense levels of activity with limited time to rest between games increases risk for injury.

What does success look like:
2. Less injuries (missed games per player; surgeries per player).
3. Increased viewership per game.

Proposed Changes:
1. There should be not less than 38 hours between tip-off of consecutive games. No more back to back games.
2. Less games in the NBA season (Pre-season + regular season + in-season tournament + post-season).
3. Reduce or eliminate pre-season games to two (1 home game & 1 away game): 
4. Playoffs reduced from best 4 of 7 to best 3 of 5.
5. Get Regular season down to ~61 games by only playing four games against 
      #teams in regional conference (3 in west, 3 in east). 
      #Play only two games against the five other regional conferences.
6. Start the season earlier

Roadblocks:
1. TV and Streaming deals -- $$$$
  a. solution: Promote games of other teams when a fan's team isn't playing.
