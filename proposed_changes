Objective: 
1. Reduce the incidence of injuries in the NBA.

The Problem:
  a. High incidence of injuries harm the longetivity of careers; put astericks next to victories; and frustrate fans.
  b. Intense levels of activity with limited time to rest increases susceptibility and risk for injury.

What does success look like:
1. Less games in the NBA season (Pre-season + regular season + in-season tournament + post-season).
2. Less injuries (missed games per player; surgeries per player).
3. Increase viewership per game.

Proposed Changes:
1. There should be not less than 42 hours between tip-off of consecutive games. No more back to back games.
2. Reduce or eliminate pre-season games to two (1 home game & 1 away game): 
3. Playoffs reduced from best 4 of 7 to best 3 of 5.
4. Get Regular season down to ~61 games by only playing four games against teams in regional conference (3 in west, 3 in east). Play only two games against the five other regional conferences.

Roadblocks:
1. TV and Streaming deals -- $$$$
  a. Promote games of other teams when a fan's team isn't playing.
