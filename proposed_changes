Objective: 
1. Reduce the incidence of injuries in the NBA. 

The Problem:
  a. High incidence of injuries harm the longetivity of careers; put astericks next to victories; and frustrate fans.
  b. Intense levels of activity with limited time to rest increases susceptibility and risk for injury.
  c. Every season, top performing players sit out games due to injury.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Maintain or Reduce the overall duration of the NBA season (Pre-season + regular season + in-season tournament + post-season)

Proposed Changes:
1. There should be not less than 42 hours between tip-off of consecutive games. 
    a. this eliminates having games two days in a row.
    b. this will reduce the wear and tear on the athletes.
2. Reduce or eliminate pre-season games: 
    a. This will allow regular season to stretch out to avoid back to back games.
    b. These games are not taken seriously, and don't count towards the season. Some teams don't play their starters.
    c. Some benefit to preparing changes to the arena with a trial run that might have smaller attendance than regular season.
3. Playoffs reduced from best 4 of 7 to best 3 of 5.
    a. Incentivize winning in regular season to get top seed. With best 3/5, the lower seed team only gets one home game if higher seed team wins three games in a row.
    b. What gets decided after seven games that can't be determined within three to five games.
    c. Time savings for the overall season will allow regular season to stretch out to avoid back to back games.
